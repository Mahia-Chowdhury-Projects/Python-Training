GRADE SHEET FOR CS134 LAB 7 ("Recursion!"):

    Warm-up Task: sum_digits
          * passes all doctests and produces correct sum
          * has an explicit base case and correctly handles it 
          * correctly handles recursive call
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * int not converted to str
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 1: bedtime
          * passes all doctests
          * has an explicit base case and correctly handles it
          * correct calls to first_sentence and last_sentence
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
          * one additional doctest is provided
    Task 2: squares
          * correctly returns the number of squares
          * draw_nested_squares(400, 20, PURPLE, WHITE) generates correct figure
          * draw_nested_squares uses only the allowed turtle commands
          * draw_nested_squares uses color, other_color rather than WHITE, PURPLE
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 3: quilt
          * correctly returns the number of squares
          * draw_quilt(512, 128, PURPLE, GOLD) generates correct figure
          * draw_quilt uses only the allowed turtle commands
          * draw_quilt uses color, other_color rather than GOLD, PURPLE
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
    Task 4: shrub
          * correctly returns the total branch length
          * draw_shrub(100, 15, 0.8, 10) generates correct figure
          * draw_shrub uses only the allowed turtle commands
          * the implementation is fully recursive; no loops are found
          * clean and interpretable code with comments
