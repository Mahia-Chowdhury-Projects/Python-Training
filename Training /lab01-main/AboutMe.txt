Tell us about yourself:

Hello! My name is Mahia and I am from Queens, New York (the best city). Because of the amazing, unbelievable diversity in Queens, there are so 
many amazing food spots. I guess if I had to choose my favorite spot, it would definitely be 
Blaze 718, located in Jamaica, Queens, New York which serves amazing Jamaican food. 
Trust me, order the oxtail...you will not regret it! And for any vegans/vegetarians, you have to get their collard greens!
I am a computer science major, and I hope to develop my knowledge in the field a lot more as I continue to be at Williams. In my free time, I enjoy crocheting, dancing, 
and reading true crime stories.
