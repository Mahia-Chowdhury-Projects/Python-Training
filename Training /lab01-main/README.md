# Lab 01 

Collaboration: *enter names of others you worked with*

This lab introduces you to the technical details of the weekly workflow.

You can find the lab handout on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/williams/spring2023/csci134/info) under the [Resources](https://piazza.com/williams/spring2023/csci134/resources) tab.

This lab's starter files:
*  README.md - this file
*  hello.py   - your first program!
*  AboutMe.txt - few sentences about me, my hometown, a good place to eat, and answers to the scavenger hunt
*  Gradesheet.md - summarizes grading guidelines for this lab, and will contain graded feedback

Do not forget to add and commit any changes you make to these files. Then "push" changes up to the CS server to make them visible to graders.
